# MNIST-dataset

The dataset is fetched online.
The training and test set are performed on the dataset. The classifier is used for finding the accuracy but to increase the accuracy one thing that can be done is decreasing the ratio of dataset or by taking "not 2" in dataset.
There might be few warning as the dataset is large but the speed of implementation same can be analyzed by decreasing ratio or the tolerance value.
It might result in accuracy change.
